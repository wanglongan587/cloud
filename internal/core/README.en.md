# internal/core: Authoritative Domain Engine

[中文](README.md) | [English](README.en.md)

`internal/core` is the authoritative domain and state-machine layer of Ora Cloud. It owns all business aggregates, state transitions, transaction boundaries, cryptographic token verification, and PostgreSQL persistence orchestration.

## Module map

- [migrations](migrations/README.en.md) defines the forward-only, linear PostgreSQL schema migration scripts and checksum verification.

## Architecture and runtime model

### Aggregates and relationships
- **Users & Identities**: Users are identified by stable IdP claims (`source`, `subject`). Huawei login keeps the IDaaS `uuid` as its subject and associates a directory-selected person through the verified `globalUserId`; employee numbers grant no access. Conflicting identity mappings are never merged automatically.
- **Tenants, Spaces & Memberships**: Each tenant has exactly one visible collaboration space, and a user may join and switch among many tenants. `tenant_memberships` is the sole authority for the peer `admin` and `member` roles and membership status. Public deployments use invitation or application links; corporate deployments verify active employees through Tianzhou.
- **Projects**: Each project belongs to a tenant and its sole collaboration space. `(tenant_id, owner_user_id)` remains the durable resource and credential ownership boundary, while any active tenant member can access tenant projects. A project links its repository URL, default branch, and `project_storage`.
- **Workspaces & Tasks**: Each project has at most one active `main` workspace (enforced by the `one_main` partial unique index). Additional workspaces are `isolated` and map 1:1 with `tasks`.
- **Operations & Effects**: Mutations (such as project creation, workspace start/stop, or deletion) execute as durable `operations` (`queued`, `running`, `retry_wait`, `blocked`, `done`, `failed`). Operations decompose into durable `effects` representing external tasks executed by Substrate and Controller.
- **Nodes & Sessions**: `workspace_nodes` represent active execution containers bound to a workspace. `sessions` track user conversational threads.

### Concurrency and locking
- **Transactional advisory lock**: Phase-one serializes domain mutations using PostgreSQL's `SELECT pg_advisory_xact_lock(67420911)` within `Store.transact`. This eliminates race conditions during aggregate state transitions while keeping locking database-local.
- **Single active operation per project**: Enforced by `idleProject`: a new project operation cannot be scheduled if another operation is currently `queued`, `running`, `retry_wait`, or `blocked`.
- **Optimistic concurrency**: Mutations on mutable entities require an explicit `version` parameter. A missing version returns `428 version_required`; a mismatched version returns `409 version_conflict`.
- **Controller leases**: Controller workers acquire exclusive leases via `/internal/v1/controller-lease/acquire`, renewed periodically. Work dispatching uses monotonic `epoch` fencing to reject stale controller instances.

### Idempotency
- Creation and joining writes require an `Idempotency-Key` header. Tenant-scoped records use `(tenant_id, user_id)`; pre-membership join records use `user_id`.
- Requests compute a SHA256 hash of the method, path, and normalized body.
- An identical request replaying an existing key returns the previously stored HTTP response.
- A differing request using the same key is rejected with `409 idempotency_conflict`.

### Authentication and trust
- `Authenticator` validates JWT tokens using Ed25519/RS256 public keys loaded at startup:
  - **Service tokens**: Carry `kind="service"` and `role` (`gateway`, `controller`, or `node`).
  - **User tokens**: Carry `kind="user"` and are forwarded in the `X-Ora-User-Token` header by the gateway. The router ensures `user.Caller == service.Subject`.

### Error handling
- The domain exclusively raises `*Fault` values containing a machine-readable `Code`, dynamic `Params`, and an HTTP `Status`.
- `ErrorCode(err)` converts domain and internal database errors into client-safe `Fault` objects, mapping unexpected errors to `500 internal_error` without leaking database schema or credential information.

## Boundaries and invariants

- **No long-lived transactions**: Transactions must never encompass network calls, Git operations, Substrate calls, or child process execution.
- **No in-memory state**: All state transitions must be committed to PostgreSQL before returning success.
- **Tenant isolation**: Project and runtime reads verify active tenant membership and scope queries by a trusted `tenant_id`. `owner_user_id` remains for resource, credential, and execution ownership; it does not exclude another member of the same tenant.
