// settleSessionEnded is the B-owned session-terminal core behind the A→B hook OnSessionEnded
// (controller-integration D6 sessionEnded, Thread D4, IssueRun D3/D4; plan §5 Batch 1).
//
// It runs on the caller-owned *transaction of the session execution's terminal-event takeover,
// inside which all of the following must commit or roll back together:
//
//	Thread terminal:   thread_state='ended', idle_since=NULL — D4's last, unconditional row:
//	                   "会话执行终态被接管 → ended". `ending` is not a precondition: the row is
//	                   stated for the session execution's terminal event, and gating on `ending`
//	                   would make the reasons that reach it without a preceding end request
//	                   (`agent_failed`, `interrupted`) permanently un-representable while leaving
//	                   the terminal event un-acked, which the Controller would replay forever.
//	Discard:           every user turn still `queued` for this run becomes `discarded` (Thread D3:
//	                   turns the session never executed are marked in the transaction that takes its
//	                   terminal state over, and are never executed by a later session).
//	Delivering:        phase='delivering', status stays 'running' (IssueRun D3's `delivering` row,
//	                   whose entry condition is "会话执行有终态结果（任何结束原因）" and whose status
//	                   column is `running`).
//	Delivery release:  the Revision delivery work item is released in this same transaction
//	                   (IssueRun D3; controller-integration D6 spells the whole obligation as one
//	                   hook: "Thread `ended`、排队轮次 `discarded`、进入 `delivering` 并放出交付工作项").
//	Hint:              `issue_run.thread_changed` — the REST representation changed. AgentFailed
//	                   also appends one safe Cloud-owned failure entry and its thread_appended hint.
//
// It never opens its own transaction, spawns a goroutine, or defers a post-commit effect. Identity
// is the two ids the control plane passes (run and execution); every business field is re-read here,
// and the execution must be this run's own registered agent_session execution, so a mis-addressed
// event can never be projected onto another run's Thread.
//
// What is deliberately NOT here: `releasing` and the `status` D4 derives from the end reason
// (written when the delivery settles), the Revision row, delivering on `DeliverRevision`, the
// Workspace delete and `done`. Those are Phase 5 Batch 2.
