# Database — for agents

PostgreSQL 17. Migrations are embedded, checksummed, applied in order by `Store.Migrate()` /
`cloudctl migrate`, recorded in `schema_migrations`. **Immutable once applied** — never edit an
applied file; add a new `NNNN_*.sql`.

## Migrations

| File | What it adds |
| --- | --- |
| `0001_core.sql` | tenants, users, user_identities, tenant_memberships, credential_refs, projects, project_storage, workspaces, workspace_worktrees, tasks, operations, external_effects, execution_tickets, sandbox_instances, node_instances, controller_leases, idempotency_records |
| `0002_aggregate_guards.sql` | deferred-constraint triggers (one main workspace per project, last-admin guard, …) |
| `0003_resource_versions.sql` | `version` columns + optimistic-concurrency backfill |
| `0004_effect_intent_and_ticket_scope.sql` | effect intent + ticket scoping hardening |
| `0005_gateway_auth.sql` | Gateway authentication tables: `gateway_login_attempts`, `gateway_sessions` (runtime-only access by `cmd/gateway`) |
| `0006_collab_spaces.sql` | **Collaboration Spaces** (upstream baseline, byte-identical to `upstream/main`): `collab_workspaces` (id, tenant_id, name, slug, description, created_by, version, archived_at; `UNIQUE(id,tenant_id)`, `UNIQUE(tenant_id,slug)`) and `collab_workspace_members` (workspace_id, user_id, role owner/admin/member, status active/disabled, version, created_by, joined_at; `PRIMARY KEY(workspace_id,user_id)`) — the Workspace resource-sharing boundary |
| `0007_project_space_scope.sql` | **Project → Space scoping** (upstream baseline, byte-identical to `upstream/main`): seeds a default Collaboration Space for every live tenant (+ its active members as owner/member), adds `projects.space_id uuid NOT NULL`, binds every existing project to the default Space, composite FK `(space_id,tenant_id) → collab_workspaces(id,tenant_id)` + index `project_space_list(space_id,id)` |
| `0008_issues.sql` | `issues` (board) — formerly `0006_issues.sql` (renumbered in the migration reconciliation so upstream 0001–0007 stay byte-identical; see `docs/migrations/workspace-integration-stage-a.md`) |
| `0009_issue_extensions.sql` | issue_statuses, issue_comments, labels, issue_labels, issue_subscribers, issue_views + `issues` ALTERs (`number`, `properties`, status format check) — formerly `0007_issue_extensions.sql` |
| `0010_issue_collaboration.sql` | `issues` ALTERs (`assignee_type`/`assignee_id`/`project_ref` + backfill), `issue_comments` ALTERs (`parent_id`/`author_type`/`author_id`/`seq` + backfill + `UNIQUE(issue_id,seq)`), new tables `issue_runs`, `issue_activities`, `issue_context_refs` — formerly `0008_issue_collaboration.sql` |
| `0011_issue_interactions.sql` | new table `issue_interactions` (the `@` interaction spine) — one row per selected collaboration target: `id, tenant_id, issue_id, comment_id, target_type, target_id, mode, task, run_id, created_at` — formerly `0009_issue_interactions.sql` |
| `0012_issue_interaction_input.sql` | one generic additive column: `ALTER TABLE issue_interactions ADD COLUMN input jsonb NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}' CHECK (jsonb_typeof(input)='object')` — the confirmed form values ([§38.30](../../migrations/multica-issue-board/12-collaboration-architecture.md#3830-does-3b-2-need-a-migration--yes-one-additive-column)). Deliberately excludes `version`, a `status` enum, `confirmed_at` and a separate inputs table. `0011` is not modified. — formerly `0010_issue_interaction_input.sql` |
| `0013_project_space_optional.sql` | **Project Space optional (append-only compatibility)**: `projects.space_id` back to **NULLABLE** — upstream `0007` imposed `NOT NULL` + full project binding; PS3/D2=C keeps Space an optional grouping. `0013` only relaxes the constraint; it deliberately **does NOT unbind** projects `0007` already assigned (no data change, no scope shrink). Space-scoped projects stay workspace-shared (Step 3 access model); new unscoped projects stay owner-only |
| `0014_tenant_membership_and_join.sql` | **Current model**: one space per tenant, globally reserved slug, tenant membership as the only role source; `projects.space_id` is mandatory again. Adds verified Huawei association and private invite/application records. Incompatible test data requires rebuilding rather than silent rewriting. |

## Table inventory

### Identity & tenancy
| Table | Purpose | Key columns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tenants` | org boundary | id, name, status, deleted_at |
| `users` | person | id, display_name, status, deleted_at |
| `user_identities` | external identity → user | user_id, source, subject |
| `tenant_memberships` | tenant↔user + role | tenant_id, user_id, role(admin/member), status |
| `credential_refs` | named secret references | tenant_id, owner_user_id, purpose, ref |

### Projects / workspaces / operations
| Table | Purpose | Key columns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `projects` | dev-environment repo | tenant_id, owner_user_id (creator), name, repository_url, default_branch, lifecycle, **space_id** (mandatory FK to the tenant's sole space) |
| `project_storage` | per-project volume state | project_id, observed_state |
| `workspaces` | main/isolated worktree env | project_id, tenant_id, owner_user_id, kind, desired/observed_state, runtime_generation |
| `workspace_worktrees` | git worktree metadata | workspace_id, branch_name, base_commit_id |
| `tasks` | isolated workspace title | workspace_id, title |
| `operations` | durable async work | tenant_id, project_id, workspace_id, kind, state, step, version |
| `external_effects` | external-action plan/evidence | operation_id, kind, state, external_id, request, result |
| `execution_tickets` | node execution lease | workspace_id, state |
| `sandbox_instances` | running sandbox | workspace_id, … |
| `node_instances` | registered nodes | connection_state, initialized, heartbeat |
| `controller_leases` | controller leadership | epoch fencing |
| `idempotency_records` | POST/DELETE replay | tenant_id, user_id, key, request_hash, response, status |

### Collaboration Spaces (current after 0014)
| Table | Purpose | Key columns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `collab_workspaces` | the tenant's sole visible space | id, tenant_id (unique), name, slug (globally unique), description, created_by, version, archived_at |
| `tenant_invitations` / `tenant_join_links` / `tenant_join_requests` | private admission | tenant_id, token_hash for links, expiry, revocation, decision, version |

**Tenant membership is authoritative**: every active member may read the tenant's projects and runtime
workspaces; project deletion requires an active tenant administrator. Disabled memberships lose new
access immediately. Earlier 0006–0013 entries above describe immutable migration history, not current policy.

### Issue board (0008–0012)
| Table | Purpose | Key columns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `issues` | board card | tenant_id, creator_user_id, assignee_type/assignee_id (polymorphic), assignee_user_id? (mirror), project_ref?, parent_issue_id?, title, description, status, priority, position, number, properties(jsonb), version, deleted_at |
| `issue_statuses` | status catalog | tenant_id, key, name, category, color, icon, is_system, position, deleted_at · UNIQUE(tenant_id,key) |
| `issue_comments` | comment thread | tenant_id, issue_id, author_user_id? (mirror), author_type/author_id (ActorRef), parent_id? (threading), body, seq, version, deleted_at · UNIQUE(issue_id,seq) |
| `issue_runs` | issue-owned run lifecycle | tenant_id, issue_id, executor_type/executor_id, status, external_execution_id?/execution_context_ref?/workflow_invocation_ref? (opaque refs), input/result/error, trigger_evidence_*, version, deleted_at |
| `issue_activities` | append-only timeline projection | tenant_id, issue_id, actor_type/actor_id, action, details(jsonb), seq, created_at |
| `issue_context_refs` | issue→external reference | tenant_id, issue_id, ref_type, ref_id, created_at · hard delete |
| `issue_interactions` | `@` interaction spine | tenant_id, issue_id, comment_id, target_type/type, target_id, mode(mention/task/form), task, run_id?, input(jsonb) · one row per selected target · `run_id IS NULL` = unconfirmed, `input` = confirmed form values |
| `labels` | tenant label | tenant_id, name, color, deleted_at · partial UNIQUE(tenant_id,name) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL |
| `issue_labels` | issue↔label join | (issue_id,label_id) PK · hard delete |
| `issue_subscribers` | issue watchers | (issue_id,user_id) PK, tenant_id |
| `issue_views` | saved filter | tenant_id, owner_user_id, name, filter(jsonb), version, deleted_at |

### Schema-ready vs. exposed (collaboration tables)

The DB is ahead of the HTTP surface on purpose — additive-first. Do not read a column's existence as
an implemented feature:

| Table / column | Persistence | API |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `issue_activities` | ✅ written internally (`appendActivity`) | ✅ `GET /issues/{iid}/timeline` (merged with comments) |
| `issue_comments.author_type` | ✅ CHECK allows `user/agent/team/system` | ✅ user + agent/team (internal run-reply path); `system` still unwritten |
| `issue_comments.seq` | ✅ shared per-issue namespace with `issue_activities.seq` | ✅ comment list and `/timeline` order by it |
| `issue_interactions` | ✅ migrations `0011` + `0012` | ✅ `GET /issues/{iid}/interactions`; written via `targets[]` on comment create, `input`/`run_id` claimed by confirm |
| `issue_runs` | ✅ full 7-state lifecycle columns | ⚠️ create/list/get; transitions driven by the (mock) dispatcher/observer, not a public state API |
| `issues.assignee_type` / `project_ref` | ✅ | ⚠️ agent/team/project refs are opaque, unresolved |

Collaboration semantics (interaction modes, `@`, cardinality, timeline) are frozen in
[12-collaboration-architecture.md §37](../../migrations/multica-issue-board/12-collaboration-architecture.md#37-wave-3b-0--collaboration-interaction-model-frozen).

## Conventions

- Every business table: `id uuid PK`, `version bigint DEFAULT 1 CHECK(version>0)`,
  `created_at`/`updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()`, soft-delete `deleted_at timestamptz`.
- **Scope = `tenant_id`**; composite FKs `(tenant_id, user_id) → tenant_memberships` bind a
  user-reference to a member-of-record.
- **Cascade behaviour is deliberate**: `issues.parent_issue_id … ON DELETE SET NULL` (orphan
  children), join tables hard-delete, business rows soft-delete.
- Query pattern: `t.list`/`t.one` → `SELECT row_to_json(resource) FROM (…) resource`, top-level
  keys camelCased, nested jsonb keys keep DB names.

## Adding a table / altering one

1. New file `internal/core/migrations/NNNN_descriptive.sql` (next number; embedded by Go embed).
2. Follow the column/constraint conventions above; add indexes for the read patterns you'll use.
3. To alter an existing table, `ALTER` in the **new** file — never edit the original.
4. `Store.Migrate()` applies pending files automatically; the upgrade test
   (`integration/cloud_test.go`) keeps a hardcoded **pre-upgrade** baseline list — add your file
   there only if the test intends to exercise upgrading *through* it, otherwise leave it.
5. If you add a tenant-scoped lookup that must exist per tenant (like the status catalog), seed it
   lazily in code (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`), not in the migration.
